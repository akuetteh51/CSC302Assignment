Write a program that randomly generates a random number which is not shown to the user (some sort of secret number). The random number should specifically be an integer between 1 and 99.

The user is then asked to guess a number within the given range (1 to 99). If the user’s guess is higher than the one guessed by the program, the user should be prompted to try again as their guess is too high. If the user’s guess is lower than the one guessed by the program, the user should be prompted to guess again as their number is too low.

 

The process should be repeated until the user guesses the number correct.

A sample run of the program is shown below (user input is in blue font).

I am thinking of a number between 1 and 99

Enter a guess: 45

Your guess is too low

Enter a new guess: 67

Your guess is too low

Enter a new guess: 90

Your guess is too high

Enter a new guess: 80

Your guess is too high

Enter a new guess: 70

Your guess is too high

Enter a new guess: 68

Congrats! The number was 68
